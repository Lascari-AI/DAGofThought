A single-pass approach can reduce global memory traffic, but requires careful synchronization and design of warp-level reductions. Multi-pass segmented approaches may be necessary for extremely large dimensions, keeping shared memory usage within 48KB per block. Efficiently coordinating thread blocks for variable batch sizes ensures each batch dimension is handled independently, respecting memory boundaries and delivering high throughput. These advanced optimizations, if implemented carefully with attention to kernel launch configuration, warp synchronization, and shared memory utilization, further boost performance beyond the initial two-pass approach while still meeting the constraints of numerical stability, memory usage, and dependency limitations.",
