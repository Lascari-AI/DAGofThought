      "Findings Summary: Our exploration continues to deepen, revealing additional considerations for an AI-centric educational system. Beyond teacher training and cultural adaptability, bridging physical and digital infrastructure gaps ensures equitable access to AI tools. Extracurricular clubs can bolster hands-on engagement and encourage creative experimentation with AI. Meanwhile, teacher retention strategies—such as offering credentials, advancement pathways, or extra stipends—can mitigate burnout and promote innovation. All these ideas reinforce the need for continuous iteration, broad stakeholder collaboration, and careful budget oversight to produce a resilient, inclusive, and future-proof model of AI-driven education.\n",
      "Remaining Questions: ['What specific frameworks ensure equal infrastructure distribution across rural and urban regions?', 'How can extracurricular AI clubs remain accessible to students who lack personal devices or stable internet?', 'Which accreditation bodies would certify advanced AI teaching credentials, and how can they be recognized globally?', 'How do we evaluate the long-term impact of these initiatives on teacher retention and student outcomes?']\n",

      "Response 3:\n",
      "Findings Summary: The evolving system underscores deeper strategies for AI-era education. While initial proposals included project-based learning, cultural adaptation, and cost-conscious teacher training, deeper scrutiny reveals further directions. We should develop standardized yet locally adaptable teacher training guidelines, ensuring that all educators possess foundational AI competencies while also tailoring to cultural norms. Metrics for success must capture creativity, critical thinking, and real-world application through portfolios and collaborative projects. Combined, these measures will create a more resilient, future-proof education system that remains affordable.\n",

      "Response 5:\n",
      "Findings Summary: We’ve begun converging on a more cohesive blueprint by introducing new child thoughts (TH_20, TH_21) under the primary system design. The near-final blueprint integrates all considerations—teacher training, data privacy, interdisciplinary curricula, mental health support, and more—under a unified approach. The next steps involve piloting these ideas in diverse settings to refine the model, then scaling according to budgetary and cultural constraints. By systematically iterating, we can approach a meaningful conclusion that balances innovation, equity, and sustainability in an AI-driven world.\n",
